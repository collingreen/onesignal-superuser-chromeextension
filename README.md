# To install locally
1. Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
2. Turn on developer mode
3. Click "Load Unpacked"
4. Upload the unzipped folder

## How to use this:
- In your chrome extensions you can pin this to the tool bar for frequent use
- Clicking the extension will allow you to enter in any App ID, Org ID, or email and search it using the super user search function on the OneSignal Dashboard (must be logged in as super user).
- When on chrome, you can highlight any text containing an email or uuid and search for that string as an app or an org (does not support email searching).
